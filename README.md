# Codeclause_Stock_Market_Prediction


In this project, we used a stacked LSTM neural network to predict the closing stock price of Tata Global Beverages Ltd. for the next 28 days. The model was trained on the stock price data from 2013 to 2018 and was tested on data from 2018 to 2019. The model's performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The predicted and actual stock prices were plotted on a graph to visualize the performance of the model.
